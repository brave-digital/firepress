# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.1 - 2016-10-26

* Simplify query construction and ensure that the correct variable types are used (previously, a numeric value
  would be wrapped into a string)

## 1.2 - 2016-10-21

* Authorization and permission errors are now thrown as `\Kreait\Firebase\Exception\PermissionDeniedException`

## 1.1.1 - 2016-09-29

* Fixed a bug that prevented querying by boolean values.

## 1.1 - 2016-07-20

* Removed deprecated methods and revisited the code and documentation.

## 0.10.2 - 2016-07-15

* Added support for authentication overrides when using a Google Service account

  * There's no need to create and set the needed custom tokens yourself.
  * The new method works regardless of whether you use a database secret or
    a Google Service Account for the basic authentication.
* Updated authentication docs
* Added methods:
  * `Firebase::setAuthOverride(string $uid, array $claims = [])`
  * `Firebase::removeAuthOverride()`
* Deprecated methods:
  * `Firebase::setAuthToken()`
  * `Firebase::getAuthToken()`
  * `Firebase::hasAuthToken()`
  * `Firebase::removeAuthToken()`

## 0.10.1 - 2016-07-03

* Added support for authentication with a Google Service account

## 0.10.0 - 2016-04-28

* Deprecated magic callers to allow writing `$firebase->foo()`

## 0.9.1 - 2016-03-18

* Added magic reference methods, to allow writing `$firebase->foo()`  
  instead of `$firebase->getReference('foo')`

## 0.9 - 2015-12-07

* Added support for shallow queries (thanks to [@famersbs](https://github.com/famersbs) for the initial 
  implementation in [#17](https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php/pull/17))

## 0.8 - 2015-12-07

## 0.6.1 - 2015-04-17

* Fixed a bug where `Reference::update()` would throw an error with multidimensional data.

## 0.6 - 2015-04-12

* Added Authentication support
* Ensure PHP7 and HHVM support
* Improved tests and general code quality

## 0.5 - 2015-04-02

* Use `Configuration` object instead of configuring `Firebase` directly.

## 0.4.2 - 2015-03-25

* Fix Query documentation
* Use Tape Recorder Subscriber for Reference Tests

## 0.3.1 - 2015-01-27

* Bugfix: Allow whitespaces in locations

## 0.3 - 2015-01-27

* **Breaking changes: References have changed behaviour**
* `Reference` doesn't extend `Firebase` anymore and has changed behaviour (see the [doc/02-references.md](documentation about References)).
* Reference data can be accessed with `$reference->getData()`, which returns an array, or directly with `$reference['key']`.
* Reference data can be updated with `$reference->update(['key' => 'value'])` or with `$reference['key'] = 'value'`.
* Improved test coverage.
* Added Makefile to ease test execution.
* Extended documentation and moved in to the doc folder.

## 0.2.4 - 2015-01-21

* Add `ext-mbstring` as a requirement in `composer.json`
* Improved test coverage and added badges to README to show it off :)

## 0.2.3 - 2015-01-20

Fixed an error where the throw of an exception would throw an exception because of a wrong usage of `sprintf()`

## 0.2.2 - 2015-01-20

Fixed a case where an exception would be thrown inside an exception when no response was present.

## 0.2.1 - 2015-01-19

The Firebase library now has its own base URL handling so that a stable version of the HTTP adapter can be used.

## 0.2 - 2015-01-13

* Better handling of server errors: Instead of using hard coded exception messages for assumed server errors, a single server error exception now includes the server's error message, if available.
* It is now possible to use the `shallow` parameter when performing a GET request. See [the Firebase Docs on Query Parameters](https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/api/#section-query-parameters) for a detailed description.
* `Firebase::push()` now returns the generated key as a string (not as an array `['name' => '...']`) anymore

## 0.1.1 - 2015-01-09

* The logger output now is less verbose and includes full URLs
* The README now includes an usage example

## 0.1 - 2015-01-09

Initial release
